# Getting Started with Backend

## Available Scripts

In the backend directory, you can run:

* `flask run`
* `python -m flask run`
* `python -m flask run --port=3000`

Runs the backend server so that the app can communicate with it.
You may need to run the `python -m flask run --port=3000` command if you are on Mac OS.
